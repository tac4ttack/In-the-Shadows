# In-the-Shadows

## Introduction

This is my first try at making a Unity project so obviously it is far from perfect. The available builds are the versions used to validate the project at 42 Paris.  

The goal was to recreate a small game prototype like "**Shadowmatic**", a puzzle game made for mobiles in 2015, more info on [www.shadowmatic.com](http://www.shadowmatic.com).

## Quick synopsis:

You are working for a company whose business is to clone planets. As part of the quality assurance team, you have to "recover" missed planet's artefacts that the copy paste team forgot to process (they are the worst).

## Features:

The goals of this school project were:

*   Recreate the gameplay of Shadowmatic, a puzzle system based on shadow puppets.
*   Have different difficulties for the puzzles (single axis rotation, dual axis rotation, rotation and translation, multiple puzzle pieces).
*   Player progression save system.
*   Level unlocking animation.
*   Mouse and keyboard control system.
*   Debug feature giving access to all levels.

I tried to push further so I added the following features:

*   3 players save slots.
*   Saving system with serialization instead of using "player prefs".
*   Settings panel for the audio and various other tweaks.
*   A tutorial system.
*   Polished scenes, engine exploration with its lightning system.

## Disclaimer:

For the moment, the build is running at a fixed resolution of __1280x720__ pixels, I need to add graphic settings customization.

Using the __PageUp__ or __PageDown__ keys will increase or decrease the graphic quality settings.
